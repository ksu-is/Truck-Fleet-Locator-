## Features
-	Vehicle Tracking: Store available vehicles with locations 
-	Driver Assignment: Automatically assign the closest driver.

- Future Enhancement: Add a web interface or integrate with Google Maps API
## Why This Project is Useful
This project is helpful because it helps Willliam's Transport save time when finding vehicles. There would be reduced errors with the help of the automatic tracking system. Drivers are ensured with faster pick up. The Fuel cost estimation helps with budgeting. Automated invoicing puts an end to paperwork. There will be pdfs.
